## 🛠️ How It Works  
1. **Navigation Bar** – Always visible on large screens, transforms into a hamburger menu on smaller devices  
2. **Marquee Offer Bar** – Scrolls continuously across the top without overlapping nav  
3. **Shopping Cart** – Clickable cart icon with item counter updates dynamically  
4. **Side Navbar** – Slides in/out with a smooth transition on mobile  
5. **Flash Animations** – Grab user attention on offers & call-to-action elements  
6. **Product Filters** – Allows users to narrow down results for easier browsing
